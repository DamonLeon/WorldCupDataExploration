# World Cup Data Exploration
An exploration of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, looking at standout players and top performers from the tournament

# Intro
On my exchange semester in the UK I was lucky enough to be able to watch most of the world cup games either at home or on a night out, being in a timezone where the games were televised at a normal hour!


Being a big football fan myself I wanted analyse the results of the World Cup from a data perspective, to better understand how the top teams performed 











# Final Visualisations
The finished dashboards can be viewed and interacted with in Tableau Public below:

# Improvements / Next Steps

I had a couple ideas for things to improve on next time or other additions that I wasn't able to include this time around: 

- Making team1 and team 2 selection work in both directions - due to the way the data is initially structured, the relevant teams are only returned once team1 has been selected (i.e you can't start off selecting team2 first then team1) . In some instances, this has the effect that it looks as if a team has only played one game (e.g Australia as team 1, Denmark as team2), but this is just the result of how the data is initially structured and all games played in the tournament are captured in the dashboard.
