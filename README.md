# World Cup Data Exploration
An exploration of the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar, looking at standout players and top performers from the tournament

# Intro
On my exchange semester in the UK I was lucky enough to be able to watch most of the world cup games either at home or on a night out, being in a timezone where the games were televised at a normal hour!
